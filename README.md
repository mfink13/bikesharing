# Bike Sharing Data

## Overview
  
  The purpose of this analysis was to determine if starting a bike share in Des Moines could be successful, based off of information from NYC. Data on trip duration, starting and ending points, user types, gender, and trips per bike were analyzed in various fashions.
  
## Results

  The resulting data has been displayed through seven different visuals, ranging from graphs on popular starting points, to peak usage hours during the day, to usage by gender compared to days of the week.  Also inculded, is a graphic on trips per bike to determine which bikes may be in more need of repair.
  
  The visuals and the descriptions of their results can be accessed and viewed here:

## Summary

  In summary, the results indicate that bike sharing could be successful in Des Moines, especially if placed in the right areas and kept in proper repair.  Based on the data from NYC, we could expect to have our user base comprised of mainly subcribers and male ones at that. As indicated by the trip duration visual, the majority of bike trips are around 10 minutes long, with few to none extending longer that one hour.  This indicates that the bikes will have high turnover rates.  The visualization displaying usage per hour will also be very handy to determine low usage times, which would be ideal for bike repair. 
  
  In order to be as informed as possible, we could take this analysis further by looking at the distance traveled per bike to be calculated along with the number of trips per bike for maintenance purposes. If we wanted to explore user data further, a visualization could be created comparing users' age to frequency of bike use.
